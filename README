Light Source Estimation using Kinect
for course project COMP558
by
Zhongshi (Sam) Jiang and
Shayan Rezvankhah

Overview:

- PCL & OpenNI based implementation
- data available at:
  https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0Bz25WYV9M32URjNlTWRPY25MdHc&usp=sharing
- high level algorithm:
  o capture data from kinect
  o filter for feasible / optimal points
  o point cloud construction
  o estimate normal
  o segmentation based on color
  o segment selection
  o estimate light source

Building:

This is rather difficult. The VS project files are semi CMake generated and hand
tweaked. The best way to build this is to hand edit the VS project files and
update the related include, library folder locations. Perhaps in a future update,
a proper CMakeLists.txt will be included.

(And for now, please don't mind the name of the bin being `openni_grabber'. It's
the starting point of the project.).
